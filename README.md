## Summary:

One potential drawback of this site is:

Once you enter one input, the data will be fresh immedietly before your second input. Instead, you could enter all fitlers at onces, and update the table that matches all criteria. 

Additional Recommendation:

1. Add an "Filter" button that refresh the table data altogether with all filter options

2. Import some different shape of UFOs images to illustrate what different types of UFOs potentially look like.
